# Contributing

The short version appears here. However, please review the [development guide][dev-guide] for
more details on expectation and how to work with the project.

* Follow the [code of conduct][code-of-conduct] in all your interactions with the project.
* Discuss any intended change by creating a new issue or commenting on an existing issue before
    creating a pull request.
* Prefer smaller incremental pull requests over a single large pull request that performs an 
    update that touches many things or performs a number of semi-related changes at once.
* Ensure the CI pipeline and all checks are passing.
* Significant changes should update the documentation.
* Include an entry to the [CHANGELOG][changelog].

Pull requests can be merged by a maintainer once it has approvals of a maintainer.
